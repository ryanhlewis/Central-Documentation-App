## Premise

This repository contains the source code for the Android release of [Central Documentation](https://github.com/ryanhlewis/Central-Documentation),
an idea to democratize and decentralize code documentation. The source code is licensed under [CC BY-NC 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/?msclkid=a93ec326c2c411ec942d4c41da4ce952).
Decentralized documentation should never find a commercial enterprise and should remain accessible for all to contribute and read. Please provide proper
attribution to this Github, or separately, the three main authors: [Kaiden Camezine](https://github.com/Kaidenpc), [Chad Graham](https://github.com/chadgraham3), and [Ryan Lewis](https://github.com/ryanhlewis),
